            <p className="subText">Battle for Utopia</p>
            <p>
              In the mountains of Nepal, a cave was discovered, holding the
              story of 4 legendary Monkz… <br /> It is said that they were so
              wise, they created a city where people lived in harmony with their
              finances, decentralized from authority. UTOPIA.
            </p>
            <p>
              The true history of the Monkz has long been forgotten, but legends
              and rumors of a portal that leads to their world have been part of
              many cultures’ lore for thousands of years. Some call it the vault
              of time. Every time the vault opens, a war breaks out between the
              world’s most powerful tribes to claim the right to enter the lost
              valley of WGMI and gain access to the secret riches of Utopia.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the year 4444, the portal opened and war broke out once again.
              Two great factions rose, The Psychic Punkz and the Alchemist
              Punkz. Which tribe will make it to the city of Utopia in the Monkz
              metaverse?
            </p>
            <p>
              Psychic Punkz possess the power of seeing the short-term future
              and therefore are excellent at fast decisions and flipping.
              Alchemist Punkz rely on their patience and conviction and
              therefore can calculate what projects will prevail long-term.
