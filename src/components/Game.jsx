                <p>
                    We represent the values of decentralization, community and freedom. Imagine what the evolution of
                    Cryptopunks would look like. Thats us!
                    <br/>
                    Futuristic mask styles, freaky hairstyles, neon eyes, lightsabers, cyber-shades, 3 species and many
                    unique traits that make our collection the freshest Punk style artwork thatâ€™s out there.
                    <br/>
                    Some traits and backgrounds are inspired and paying homage to Fidenza, Cyberkongz, Cryptoadz,
                    Dystopunks, Cryptopunks, and the culture of our generation. By holding one future punk you are
                    holding the membership pass to our DAO ecosystem with future drops and many perks.
                    <br/>
                    We believe that web3 is the Future and that we can create a decentralized world.
                     <br/><br/>
                    <strong>Lets DAO it the right way.</strong>

                            end of the game. Small battles and attacks gives your team the
                            opportunity to challenge the others and steal from them.

                            The winner gets the right over both wallets. We will not only
